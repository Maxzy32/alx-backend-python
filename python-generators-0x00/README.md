# Python Generators - Project 0x00

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project introduces advanced usage of **Python generators** to efficiently handle large datasets, stream data from SQL databases, and simulate real-world data handling scenarios.

It is the first task in the ALX backend specialization focused on **memory-efficient Python data processing**, especially in database-driven applications.

## ðŸ“„ Task 0: Getting Started with Python Generators

### Objective

Create a Python script (`seed.py`) that:
- Sets up a MySQL database (`ALX_prodev`)
