# Python Testing Project

This project demonstrates how to write **unit tests** and **integration tests** in Python using the built-in `unittest` framework and tools like `parameterized` and `mock`.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the difference between unit and integration tests.
- Write unit tests to validate individual functions.
- Use mocking to isolate units of code during tests.
- Apply parameterization to test with multiple sets of inputs.
- Execute tests from the command line using `unittest`.
- Follow Python coding standards and use type annotations.
